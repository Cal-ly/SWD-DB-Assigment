\subsection{Mock Data}
This section contains the SQL code for inserting mock data into the tables. 
Note the use of reseeding the ID of all tables to 1, so that the mock data can be inserted without having to worry about the ID.
This of course is only intended for mock data, and should not be used in a production environment.
The mock data is in Danish, because the UTF-8 encoding took me a little while to troubleshoot, so I am keeping the æ, ø and å.
